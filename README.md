## The problem

Modern AI agents are ungoverned systems:

1. **Intent drift** — User says X, agent outputs Y.
2. **Context explosion** — Full codebase in prompt. Tokens burn.
3. **Proof-free completion** — "Looks good" = done.
4. **Boundary violation** — Agent writes to protected branches.

No controller. No contract. No proof.

---

## What Decapod is

The control plane your agent **defers to**:

- Before action:   "what's the intent?"
- Before inference: "what's relevant?"
- Before commit:  "did this pass?"

Not another tool. Not a prompt. Not a daemon. Just the layer that holds the agent accountable.

### The governance loop

```
        ┌──────────┐        ┌──────────┐
        │  User   │◄───────│  Agent   │
        └────┬────┘        └────┬────┘
             │                 │
             │      ┌─────────▼────────┐
             │      │    Decapod     │◄── Intent?
             │      │   (govern)   │    Boundary?
             │      │             │    Context?
             │      │             │    Proof?
             │      └─────────▲────────┘
             │              │
      ┌───────▼──────┐     │    ┌──────────┐
      │   Agent     │─────┴────│  Model  │
      └────────────┘          └──────────┘
             │                   │
             └─────────┬─────────┘
                       ▼
                     User
```

Every action: check intent → resolve context → enforce boundary → verify proof.

## Why this exists

Every platform shift needs its defining layer:

- Containers needed Docker → deployment became unit-based.
- Web needed Rails → productivity became declarative.
- JS needed Node → server-side became accessible.
- Agents need Decapod → governance became explicit.

Before this, agents had tools. After this, agents have **control planes**.

Decapod is the layer that says:

- "Stop. What's the intent?"
- "Wait. What's in scope?"
- "Hold on. Did you prove it?"

### Your project interface

Your interface with Decapod is `.decapod/OVERRIDE.md` — plain English overrides to your project:

```text
.decapod/
  constitution/              # governance rules
    core/DECAPOD.md         # core contract
    interfaces/             # interfaces
    plugins/                # plugin policies
  OVERRIDE.md               # YOUR overrides
```

This mounts into your agent's instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`) — augmenting what your agent sees without editing the original files.

Your agent doesn't load 50-page specs every session. Decapod resolves only what's relevant, binds it to a session lease, and enforces that the agent use it — not the raw file again.

---

## What you get

- **Daemonless** — runs on-demand, exits immediately.
- **Two commands** — install + init. Done.
- **Agent-agnostic** — Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, any shell-out.
- **Parallel-safe** — multiple agents, one repo, no collisions.
- **Proof-gated** — `VERIFIED` means gates passed.
- **Auditable** — every decision in `.decapod/` as plain files.
- **Constitutional** — your overrides take precedence.

## Before / After

### Before

```
User:  "fix the login bug"
Agent: [proceeds]
       → burns tokens on full codebase
       → generates code
       → "looks good"
       → commits
```

### After

```
User:  "fix the login bug"
Agent: [checks with Decapod]
       → intent: clarify login flow?
       → asks user
       → generates fix
Agent: [checks with Decapod]
       → proof: generated
       → commits with artifact
```

The difference: **intent → context → code → proof**.

---

## Running

```bash
cargo install decapod
decapod init
```

Your workflow doesn't change. The agent calls Decapod. You just use your agent as normal.

---

## Guarantees

Decapod enforces:

1. **Daemonless** — no background process. [tests/daemonless_lifecycle.rs](tests/daemonless_lifecycle.rs)
2. **Repo-native** — state in `.decapod/`, not external. [src/core/store.rs](src/core/store.rs)
3. **Proof-gated** — `VERIFIED` only when gates pass. [tests/workunit_publish_gate.rs](tests/workunit_publish_gate.rs)
4. **Workspace isolation** — no direct protected branch writes. [tests/workspace_interlock.rs](tests/workspace_interlock.rs)
5. **Bounded validation** — no infinite hangs. [tests/validate_termination.rs](tests/validate_termination.rs)
6. **Store boundary** — agents use CLI, not direct mutation.
