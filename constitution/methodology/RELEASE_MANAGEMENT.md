## 1. Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning
- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes
- **MINOR:** New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes

### Version Format
```
vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Example: v2.1.0
```

---

## 2. Release Channels

### Stable
- Production-ready releases
- Requires passing all gates
- Must have proof artifacts

### Beta
- Pre-release testing
- Limited scope rollout
- Faster iteration

### Canary
- Early access to new features
- Limited traffic percentage
- Rapid feedback collection

---

## 3. Release Process

### Pre-Release
1. All tests passing
2. Security scan complete
3. Documentation updated
4. Changelog generated
5. Version bump committed

### Release
1. Tag created (`vX.Y.Z`)
2. Build artifacts published
3. Deployment initiated
4. Smoke tests executed

### Post-Release
1. Monitoring verified
2. Changelog published
3. Stakeholders notified
4. Regression plan documented

---

## 4. Deployment Strategy

### Blue-Green
- Two identical environments
- Switch traffic atomically
- Fast rollback

### Rolling
- Gradual rollout
- Health checks between batches
- Configurable pace

### Feature Flags
- Ship behind flags
- Enable progressively
- Remove when stable

---

## 5. Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Triggers
- Error rate > 5%
- Latency p99 > 2x baseline
- Any SEV1/SEV2 alert

### Manual Rollback
1. Identify last known good version
2. Revert deployment
3. Verify service health
4. Document incident

---

## 6. Agent Responsibilities

When agents prepare releases:
1. Generate changelog from commits
2. Bump version following semver
3. Ensure all gates pass
4. Create release PR
5. Verify post-deployment health
