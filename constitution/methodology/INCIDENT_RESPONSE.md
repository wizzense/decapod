## 2. Response Procedure

### Detection
- Automated alerts from observability systems
- User reports via designated channels

### Initial Response (0-15 minutes)
1. Acknowledge incident in #incident-response channel
2. Assess severity and category
3. Identify scope and impact
4. Assign incident commander

### Containment (15-60 minutes)
1. Implement temporary mitigation
2. Preserve evidence for post-mortem
3. Communicate status to stakeholders

### Resolution (60+ minutes)
1. Implement fix or rollback
2. Verify resolution
3. Document root cause

## 3. Agent Responsibilities

When assisting with incidents:
1. **Stop non-essential work** - Abandon tasks to focus on incident
2. **Use incident channel** - All comms in designated channel
3. **Preserve state** - Don't modify production without approval
4. **Document actions** - Log all changes made
5. **Request escalation** - Escalate if blocked or unclear

## 4. Post-Incident

### Post-Mortem Requirements
- Root cause analysis
- Timeline of events
- Impact assessment
- Corrective actions with owners

### Prevention
- Update validation gates to catch similar issues
- Add monitoring for early detection
- Update runbooks as needed
