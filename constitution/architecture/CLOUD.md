## 1. Cloud Architecture Principles

### 1.1 Design for Failure
**Everything fails, all the time.**
- Hardware fails
- Networks partition
- Services degrade
- Regions go offline

**Resilience requires:**
- Redundancy at every layer
- Automated recovery
- Graceful degradation
- Circuit breakers and bulkheads

### 1.2 Elasticity
**Scale horizontally, not vertically.**
- Add/remove instances based on demand
- Stateless services enable elasticity
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Scale to zero for cost savings (serverless)

### 1.3 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**If it's not in code, it doesn't exist.**
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible environments
- Peer review for changes
- Automated testing and deployment

### 1.4 Cost Awareness
**Cloud costs are architecture decisions.**
- Visibility into spending
- Reserved capacity for steady-state
- Spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- Right-sizing resources

### 1.5 Production Mindset
Cloud infrastructure decisions have direct business consequences. Apply the same rigor to infrastructure as to application code:

- **Unit economics are the architecture test:** If the cost to serve one customer exceeds the revenue they generate, the architecture is broken regardless of how elegantly it scales. Every architectural decision has a cost per unit; make it visible.
- **Portability is leverage, not ideology:** Full vendor lock-in is a negotiating failure. Using managed services accelerates delivery — that's the right trade — but core domain logic must remain portable enough to migrate within a reasonable window if vendor economics turn predatory.
- **Click-ops in production is a defect:** Infrastructure that was configured through a web console cannot be reviewed, versioned, tested, or recovered reliably. Every production state change must be expressed in code and promoted through the same review process as application changes.
- **Cost is an engineering signal, not a finance problem:** If an engineer cannot explain the cost impact of a PR, it cannot ship. Cloud spend is a direct output of architectural decisions; teams own that number.
- **Stateless compute is the default contract:** Any compute that accumulates local state breaks auto-scaling and complicates recovery. If an instance cannot be terminated safely at any moment, the system is brittle by design.
- **FaaS has a shape constraint:** Serverless functions are excellent for event-driven, bursty workloads. They are poor fits for consistent, high-throughput, latency-sensitive APIs where cold starts are visible and predictable resource allocation matters.
- **Least privilege is non-negotiable:** IAM roles must be scoped per service, per action, per resource. Wildcard permissions in production are a critical security defect. A compromised service must not be a pivot to adjacent systems.

## 2. Compute Options

### 2.1 Virtual Machines (IaaS)
**When to use:**
- Legacy applications
- Full control over OS
- Specific kernel requirements
- Long-running compute

**Examples:** EC2, GCE, Azure VMs

### 2.2 Containers (CaaS)
**When to use:**
- Microservices
- Consistent environments
- Rapid scaling
- Resource efficiency

**Orchestration:**
- Kubernetes: Industry standard, complex
- ECS/Fargate: AWS-native, simpler
- Cloud Run: Serverless containers

### 2.3 Serverless (FaaS)
**When to use:**
- Event-driven workloads
- Variable traffic
- Rapid development
- Cost optimization (pay per use)

**Examples:** Lambda, Cloud Functions, Azure Functions

**Limitations:**
- Cold start latency
- Execution time limits
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited local state

### 2.4 Platform as a Service (PaaS)
**When to use:**
- Focus on application, not infrastructure
- Rapid prototyping
- Standard web applications

**Examples:** Heroku, App Engine, Elastic Beanstalk

## 3. Deployment Patterns

### 3.1 Blue-Green Deployment
- Two identical environments
- Instant cutover (DNS or LB switch)
- Easy rollback
- Requires double capacity

### 3.2 Canary Deployment
- Deploy to small subset of users
- Monitor metrics
- Gradually increase traffic
- Automatic rollback on errors

### 3.3 Rolling Deployment
- Replace instances gradually
- No capacity overhead
- Slower rollback
- Version mix during deployment

### 3.4 Feature Flags
- Decouple deployment from release
- Gradual rollout by user segment
- A/B testing
- Instant rollback (toggle off)

---

## 4. High Availability

### 4.1 Multi-AZ (Availability Zone)
- Deploy across 3 AZs minimum
- AZs are independent data centers
- Automatic failover
- No additional latency

### 4.2 Multi-Region
- Deploy to multiple regions
- Active-active or active-passive
- Geographic redundancy
- DR for region failure
- Data residency compliance

### 4.3 Load Balancing
- **Layer 4 (TCP):** Fast, simple
- **Layer 7 (HTTP):** Content-based routing
- **Health checks:** Route around failures
- **Sticky sessions:** Minimize (breaks elasticity)

### 4.4 Health Checks
- **Liveness:** Is the process running?
- **Readiness:** Is it ready to serve traffic?
- **Startup:** Is initialization complete?
- Separate probes for different concerns

## 5. Storage in Cloud

### 5.1 Object Storage (S3, GCS, Blob)
- **Use for:** Files, images, backups, static assets
- **Benefits:** Infinite scale, high durability, cheap
- **Limitations:** No partial updates, eventual consistency
- **Performance:** CloudFront/CloudFlare for edge caching

### 5.2 Block Storage (EBS, Persistent Disks)
- **Use for:** VM disks, databases
- **Types:** SSD (performance), HDD (capacity)
- **Snapshots:** Point-in-time backups
- **Multi-attach:** Some volumes to multiple instances

### 5.3 File Storage (EFS, Filestore)
- **Use for:** Shared filesystems
- **Benefits:** NFS-compatible, auto-scaling
- **Latency:** Higher than block storage

---

## 6. Networking

### 6.1 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Isolated network environment
- Subnets (public/private)
- Route tables control traffic flow
- Network ACLs and security groups

### 6.2 Security Groups vs NACLs
**Security Groups (Stateful):**
- Instance-level
- Allow rules only
- Stateful (return traffic automatic)
- Default deny

**NACLs (Stateless):**
- Subnet-level
- Allow and deny rules
- Stateless (explicit return rules)
- Ordered rules

### 6.3 API Gateway
- **Purpose:** Entry point for APIs
- **Features:** Rate limiting, auth, caching, monitoring
- **Benefits:** Decouple clients from services
- **Patterns:** BFF, aggregation, protocol translation

### 6.4 Service Mesh
- **Purpose:** Service-to-service communication
- **Features:** mTLS, traffic management, observability
- **Examples:** Istio, Linkerd, AWS App Mesh
- **Trade-off:** Complexity vs capabilities

---

## 7. Operational Excellence

### 7.1 Monitoring
- **Metrics:** CloudWatch, Datadog, Prometheus
- **Logs:** Centralized (ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch)
- **Traces:** Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- **Alerts:** Paging for symptoms, not causes

### 7.2 CI/CD
- **Pipeline:** Build → Test → Deploy
- **Automation:** Reduce manual steps
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, security, performance
- **GitOps:** Git as source of truth for deployments

### 7.3 Disaster Recovery
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Max acceptable data loss
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Max acceptable downtime
- **Backup strategies:** Automated, tested, offsite
- **Runbooks:** Documented procedures

### 7.4 Cost Optimization
- **Right-sizing:** Match resources to workload
- **Reserved instances:** Predictable workloads
- **Spot instances:** Fault-tolerant batch jobs
- **Auto-scaling:** Scale down when not needed
- **Tagging:** Attribute costs to teams/projects

- **Examples:** AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault

### 8.3 Encryption
- **At rest:** Database, storage encryption
- **In transit:** TLS everywhere
- **Key management:** KMS, HSM for high security
