# Interfaces

## Contract Principles
- Prefer explicit schemas over implicit behavior.
- Every mutating interface defines idempotency semantics.
- Every failure path maps to a typed, documented error code.

## CLI Layer
Defines command-line interface and argument parsing for all Decapod commands. CLI contracts should describe command purpose, preconditions, expected side effects, output shape, recovery path, and whether the command may mutate `.decapod/` state.

## Agent Interface
Agent-facing documentation (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) and the Universal Agent Contract mandate Decapod usage patterns. Product docs under `docs/agent` and `docs/book` teach Decapod itself; generated specs under `.decapod/generated/specs/` teach the current repository to active agents.

## Generated Contract Depth
Generated interface specs should include more than endpoint names:
- Command/RPC trigger conditions and required prior Decapod calls.
- Read/write ownership for each store and generated artifact path.
- Idempotency and retry behavior for mutations.
- Typed failure classes and concrete recovery instructions.
- Compatibility expectations for existing agent workflows.
- Evidence an agent must attach before claiming an interface change complete.

## API / RPC Contracts
| Interface | Method | Request Schema | Response Schema | Errors | Idempotency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` |

## Event Consumers
| Consumer | Event | Ordering Requirement | Retry Policy | DLQ Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` |

## Outbound Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose | SLA | Timeout | Circuit-Breaker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` |

## Inbound Contracts
- API / RPC entrypoints:
- CLI surfaces:
- Event/webhook consumers:
- Repository-detected surfaces: cargo

## Data Ownership
- Source-of-truth tables/collections:
- Cross-boundary read models:
- Consistency expectations:

## Error Taxonomy Example (cli)
```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ApiError {
    #[error("validation failed: {0}")]
    Validation(String),
    #[error("upstream timeout")]
    UpstreamTimeout,
    #[error("conflict: {0}")]
    Conflict(String),
}
```

## Failure Semantics
| Failure Class | Retry/Backoff | Client Contract | Observability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validation | No retry | 4xx typed error | warn log + metric |
| Dependency timeout | Exponential backoff | 503 with retryable code | error log + alert |
| Conflict | Conditional retry | 409 with conflict detail | info log + metric |

## Timeout Budget
| Hop | Budget (ms) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Client -> Edge/API | 500 | Includes auth + routing |
| API -> Domain | 300 | Includes validation |
| Domain -> Store/Dependency | 200 | Includes retry overhead |

## Interface Versioning
- Version strategy (`v1`, date-based, semver):
- Backward-compatibility guarantees:
- Deprecation window and removal policy:
