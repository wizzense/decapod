# Validation

## Validation Philosophy
> Validation is a release gate, not documentation theater.

## Validation Harness
The validate.rs module implements a comprehensive, extensible validation suite with clear pass/fail/warn semantics and auto-remediation hints. Key features include:
- **Methodology Gates**: Numerous validation gates enforce intent-driven development practices
- **Auto-Remediation Hints**: Provides specific guidance on how to fix validation failures
- **Workspace Enforcement**: Ensures agents work in isolated git worktrees or containers
- **Specs Integrity**: Validates that living specs match repository state
- **Proof Requirements**: Requires evidence artifacts for promotion gates
- **Constitution Integration**: Validates adherence to embedded constitution directives

## Generated Spec Refresh Gates
Decapod must keep generated specs synchronized at governance pressure points. When repository surfaces change, validation should either fail with a concrete refresh instruction or, when explicitly requested through a refresh path, regenerate the existing spec files and update the manifest fingerprint. Refresh must update the canonical spec set rather than creating one-off analysis files.

Refresh-capable paths:
- `decapod validate --refresh-specs`
- `decapod rpc --op specs.refresh`
- initialization or scaffold refresh paths that regenerate `.decapod/generated/specs/*.md`

Refresh output requirements:
- Preserve hand-maintained epistemic custody fields where possible.
- Blend repo context into the existing canonical spec files.
- Update `.decapod/generated/specs/.manifest.json` after writing files.
- Avoid adding parallel project-state or architecture-survey documents outside the canonical spec set.

- Required integration/e2e commands:

## Promotion Gates

## Blocking Gates
| Gate | Command | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture + interface drift check | `decapod validate` | Gate output |
| Tests pass | project test command | CI + local logs |
| Docs + changelog current | repo docs checks | PR diff |
| Security critical checks pass | security scanner suite | scanner reports |

## Warning Gates
| Gate | Trigger | Follow-up SLA |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage regression warning | Coverage drops below target | 48h |
| Non-blocking perf drift | P95 regression below hard threshold | 72h |

## Evidence Artifacts
| Artifact | Path | Required For |
|---|---|---|
| Validation report | `.decapod/generated/artifacts/provenance/*` | Promotion |
| Test logs | CI artifact store | Promotion |
| Architecture diagram snapshot | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Promotion |
| Changelog entry | `CHANGELOG.md` | Promotion |

## Regression Guardrails
- Baseline references:
- Statistical thresholds (if non-deterministic):
- Rollback criteria:

## Bounded Execution
| Operation | Timeout | Failure Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Validation | 30s | timeout or lock |
| Unit test suite | project-defined | non-zero exit |
| Integration suite | project-defined | non-zero exit |
