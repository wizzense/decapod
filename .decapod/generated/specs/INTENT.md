# Intent

## Product Outcome
- Decapod is the daemonless, local-first governance kernel behind AI coding agents. Agents call it on demand to converge on human intent, shape context before inference, enforce boundaries, and deliver proof-backed completion across concurrent multi-agent work.

```

## Inferred Baseline
- Repository: decapod
- Product type: service_or_library
- Primary languages: Rust
- Detected surfaces: cargo

## Scope
| Area | In Scope | Proof Surface |
|---|---|---|
| Core workflow | Define a concrete user-visible workflow | Acceptance criteria + tests |
| Data contracts | Document canonical inputs/outputs | [INTERFACES.md](./INTERFACES.md) and schema checks |
| Delivery quality | Block promotion on broken proof surfaces | [VALIDATION.md](./VALIDATION.md) blocking gates |

## Non-Goals (Falsifiable)
| Non-goal | How to falsify |
|---|---|
| Feature creep beyond the primary outcome | Any PR adds capability not tied to outcome criteria |
| Shipping without evidence | Missing validation artifacts for promoted changes |
| Ambiguous ownership boundaries | Missing owner/system-of-record in interfaces |

## Constraints
- Technical: runtime, dependency, and topology boundaries are explicit.
- Operational: deployment, rollback, and incident ownership are defined.
- Security/compliance: sensitive data handling and authz are mandatory.

## Acceptance Criteria (must be objectively testable)
- [ ] Decapod validate passes, required tests pass, and promotion-relevant artifacts are present.
- [ ] Non-functional targets are met (latency, reliability, cost, etc.).
- [ ] Validation gates pass and artifacts are attached.
- [ ] `cargo test` passes for unit/integration coverage
- [ ] `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passes with no denied lints
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check` passes on the repo

## Tradeoffs Register
| Decision | Benefit | Cost | Review Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simplicity vs extensibility | Faster iteration | Potential rework | Feature set expands |
| Strict gates vs dev speed | Higher confidence | More upfront discipline | Lead time regressions |

## First Implementation Slice
- [ ] Define the smallest user-visible workflow to ship first.
- [ ] Define required data/contracts for that workflow.
- [ ] Define what is intentionally postponed until v2.

## Open Questions (with decision deadlines)
| Question | Owner | Deadline | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Which interfaces are versioned at launch? | TBD | YYYY-MM-DD | |
| Which non-functional target is hardest to hit? | TBD | YYYY-MM-DD | |
