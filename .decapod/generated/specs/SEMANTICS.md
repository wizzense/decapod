## Trajectory Concepts
The current todo-centric model shows signs of strain when representing complex, evolving work:
- **Atomic Task Bias**: Treating work as discrete tickets loses the narrative of how intent evolves over time through iterations, pivots, and discoveries.
- **Context Loss**: Each todo is an isolated unit; there's no inherent mechanism to carry forward assumptions, context summaries, or learned lessons across a sequence of related work.
- **Manual Coordination**: Agents must manually maintain epistemic custody (preserving intent-context-assumptions-action-proof chains) across multiple todos, which is error-prone.
- **Limited Retrospection**: While the worker loop records lessons, there's no first-class construct for representing the evolutionary path of a feature or system.
- **Overloading Todo Fields**: Current attempts to store trajectory-like data (e.g., in description, tags, or custom fields) fight against the todo subsystem's primary purpose as a task tracker.
- **Missing Abstractions**: Concepts like "work streams," "feature branches," "evolutionary trajectories," or "custody chains" lack explicit representation, forcing agents to encode them implicitly in todo relationships or external documentation.

Trajectories as first-class entities would provide:
- Explicit modeling of work sequences with temporal ordering and state evolution.
- Built-in mechanisms for preserving uncertainty and recursive continuity of assumptions.
- Natural encapsulation of intent-context-specs-state-proof chains.
- Improved tooling for visualizing and navigating work histories.
- Better alignment with how humans and agents actually work in iterative, discovery-driven processes.

## Recommended Redesign Seam for Trajectories
The most appropriate seam for introducing trajectories is at the intersection of the todo, spec, and workunit subsystems, without replacing any existing functionality:
1. **Extend the Workunit Concept**: Elevate workunit.rs from a per-task manifest to a potential trajectory container. A trajectory could be a linked series of workunits representing the evolution of a feature, architectural decision, or system component.
2. **Trajectory Spec**: Introduce a new spec type (e.g., `TRAJECTORY.md`) in `.decapod/generated/specs/` that documents the evolutionary path, key decisions, and state transitions of a coherent work effort.
3. **Minimal Core Changes**:
   - Add a `trajectory_id` field to the workunit model (optional, for grouping).
   - Create a new `trajectory.rs` subsystem for trajectory-specific operations (creation, linking, state transitions).
   - Extend the validation harness to check trajectory integrity (e.g., monotonic state progression, proof linkage).
   - Add CLI commands under `decapod trajectory` for trajectory management (init, list, show, transition).
4. **Preserve Existing Todos**: Keep the todo subsystem unchanged for atomic task tracking. Trajectories would coordinate or group todos but not replace them.
5. **Leverage Existing Mechanisms**:
   - Use the existing event journaling pattern for trajectory mutations.
   - Reuse the spec manifest system for trajectory specs.
   - Utilize the workspace subsystem for trajectory-scoped isolation (optional).
   - Depend on the constitution for trajectory-related directives (e.g., methodology/trajectory_lifecycle).
